According benchmark:
(1) Eigen project 
Eigen is a high-level C++ library of template headers for linear algebra, 
matrix and vector operations, numerical solvers and related algorithms. 
Eigen is an open source library licensed under MPL2 starting from version 
3.1.1. Earlier versions were licensed under LGPL3+.
Eigen is often noted for its elegant API, versatile fixed and dynamic matrix 
capabilities and a range of dense and sparse solvers. To achieve high 
performance, Eigen utilizes explicit vectorization for the SSE 2/3/4, 
ARM NEON, and AltiVec instruction sets.

In our project, Eigen 3.2.0 is chosen and compared testing.

(2) Trilinos Epetra module 
Epetra provides the fundamental construction routines and services 
function that are required for serial and parallel linear algebra 
libraries. Epetra provides the underlying foundation for all Trilinos 
solvers.

In our project, Trilinos 11.12.1(Epetra Module) is chosen and compared 
testing. If you have any question, please contact the author.
