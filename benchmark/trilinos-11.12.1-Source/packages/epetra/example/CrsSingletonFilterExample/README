This example is meant to be compiled as a stand-alone program using a installed version
of Trilinos.  The Epetra, TriUtils and Ifpack packages are the only required packages.

Once you have built and installed Trilinos, edit the Makefile so that the location
of the Trilinos install directory points to your installation.  Then type make.
